Analyzing the Geographic Variability of Butterfly Species in Canada and Norway

# Comments

Noah:
- Both plots clearly outline the comparison between Lepidoptera BINs between Canada and Norway, leading to a couple quesitons about sampling bias vs. true prevalence.
- The interpretations (in the Discussion section) present some good arguments for why there may be more Lepidoptera species in Canada vs. Norway, and are presented clearly
- Some ideas to improve the code in the future:
  - keep formatting consistent (spacing, commenting, grammar, etc.). This could be done post-writing with the styler::style_dir() command or the formatR addin for Rstudio.
  - If a comparison for species richness across a latitude range is being restricted due to the size differences between Canada (~41째N to 81째N) and Norway (~58째N to 71째N) maybe comparing just between latitudes and not particular countries would provide a more balanced comparison.
  - Rather than a histogram, a scatterplot with a fitted regression line might better showcase the differences in species richness vs. latitudal distribution.
